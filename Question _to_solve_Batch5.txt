Question 1

Create Price Point Column : Logic below 

> if productprice is greater than $500 then "High"

> between 100 and 500 "mid range"

> less than or equal to 100 "low"

PricePoint = IF(Products_Lookup[ProductPrice]>500, " High",IF(Products_Lookup[ProductPrice]>100,"Mid_Range","Low") )


Question 2 

Create a measure called All Returns (similar to all orders we had created earlier  - Answer should be 1809

AllReturns = CALCULATE([TotalReturns],ALL(Returns)) 

Question 3

Create a measure  called "% of all Returns" - answer should be 61.64% for accesories product

% of All Returns = [TotalReturns]/[ALL Returns]


Question 4

Create a measure name Bike Returns to calculate total returns for bikes -- answer should be 427


BikeReturns = CALCULATE([TotalReturns], Product_Categories[CategoryName]= "Bikes")


Question 5 

Create a measure named "Total Cost" by mutliplying order quantities by product costs at row level - answer should be $1,456,986

TotalCost = SUMX(AW_Sales, AW_Sales[OrderQuantity]*RELATED(Products_Lookup[ProductCost]))

Question 6

Create Total Profit , defined as Total Revenue minus Total Cost -- Answer should be $10,457,580


TotalProfit = [TotalRevenue]-[TotalCost]


Question 7
Create a measure to calculate Total Order for Previous month (name it as "Prev Month Order")

PrevMonthOrders = CALCULATE([TotalOrders], DATEADD(Calendar_Lookup[Date],-1,MONTH))

Question 8 : 

Create a measure named "Order Target", calculated as a 10% lift over the previous month 

OrderTarget = [PrevMonthOrders]*1.1 


Question 9 :

â€¢	Total Returns for the previous month (named "Prev Month Returns") 


Question 10 : Rolling Profit (named "90-day Rolling Profit") 


90-dayRollingProfit = 


10-dayRollingRevenue =
